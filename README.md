## Getting Started

To get a local instance of NexusShare up and running, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
* Node.js (v14.x or newer)
* npm (v6.x or newer)
* MongoDB (running locally or via a service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexus-share.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexus-share.git)
    cd nexus-share
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory** and populate it with your environment variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    ```

4.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    You will need two separate terminal sessions to run both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.

    * **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        npm run dev
        ```

    * **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Client**
        ```bash
        # From the project's root directory
        npm run dev
        ```

    Your application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
